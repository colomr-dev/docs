## Data Lake

A large, centralized repository that stores raw data in its native format, without being transformed or structured for specific analysis. Data lakes are designed to accommodate a wide variety of data types, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

## Data Mesh

A modern data architecture that distributes data ownership and management across domain-specific teams. Each team owns and manages the data that is relevant to their domain, and they are responsible for ensuring that the data is accurate, consistent, and up-to-date.

## Big Lake

A unified data platform that integrates data lakes, data warehouses, and data streams into a single architecture. Big Lake makes it possible to store, analyze, and process data from all sources using a variety of tools and technologies.

## Data Lake

A large, centralised repository that stores raw data in its native format, without being transformed or structured for specific analysis. Data lakes are designed to accommodate a wide variety of data types, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

## Data Mesh

A modern data architecture that distributes data ownership and management across domain-specific teams. Each team owns and manages the data that is relevant to their domain, and they are responsible for ensuring that the data is accurate, consistent, and up-to-date.

## Big Lake

A unified data platform that integrates data lakes, data warehouses, and data streams into a single architecture. Big Lake makes it possible to store, analyse, and process data from all sources using a variety of tools and technologies.

## House Lake

A proprietary data architecture that combines the characteristics of data lakes and data warehouses. House lakes store data in a structured format, but they also allow for the storage of raw, unprocessed data. This hybrid approach provides the benefits of both data lakes and data warehouses, making it a good option for organisations that need a flexible and scalable data platform.

This is the first step, or maybe ZERO, to master the PDE certification exam.

## Certification Exam Guide (CEG)&#x20;

Please review the CEG, this guide provides comprehensive information about the exam objectives, format, and scoring, as well as detailed study recommendations.

## Personal Study Method&#x20;

This study method is based on my personal experience, it is not a general formula that can be applied to all students; Each individual has a learning process and pace on top of a mixture of theory, practice and real situations to rock-solid the key concepts necessaries to pass the exam.

## PDE Study Material (kanban)

In my Github profile you can find these notes (and download them), the code repositories and the teaching material that I have used to prepare the certification: from books, labs, exam platforms or links to other interesting repositories from other students.

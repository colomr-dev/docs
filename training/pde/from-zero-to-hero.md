# ðŸ¦¸ 0 Â· From Zero to Hero

This is the first step, or maybe ZERO, to master the PDE certification exam.

## Certification Exam Guide (CEG)&#x20;

This guide provides comprehensive information about the exam objectives, format, and scoring, as well as detailed study recommendations.

## Personal study method&#x20;

This study method is based on my personal experience, it is not a general formula that can be applied to all students; Each individual has a learning process that can combine a mixture of theory, practice and work environment situations to internalize the concepts that must be established to pass the exam.

## Check my GitHub to dig further

In my Github profile you can find these notes (and download them), the code repositories and the teaching material that I have used to prepare the certification: from books, labs, exam platforms or links to other interesting repositories from other students.

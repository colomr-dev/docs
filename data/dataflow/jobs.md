The easiest way is to create jobs by using predefined templates, but jobs can also be created by custom code with Apache Beam model.

In the screenshot above we are configuring a job using `WorldCount` template, which will produce the same result as using this [python code](http://localhost:5000/s/tCTYvzfGm8ZpENGpw2Wu/snippets/dataflow#basic-job-to-try-dataflow-python).

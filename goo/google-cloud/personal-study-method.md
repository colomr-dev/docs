## From Zero to Hero ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is a previous stage where I usually do a research on what the certification exam will cover. A good starting points to do so are:

* Read the official **Certification Exam Guide** (CEG) carefully
* Read the **most up-to-date book** on the certification to prepare
* Explore **GitHub repositories** to find study **materials** and other **resources**

After completing these steps we'll get a high-level overview of the main topics for the exam.

## Key Concepts ‚úç

Once we identified the main exam topics, it's time to get to work taking the corresponding _Learning Path_ in [**Cloud Skills Boost**](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/). I suggest not missing any lab on this.

And just when the Learning Path is done, we're in a good point to write down the documento "**1 ¬∑ XXX Key Concepts**", this document is an index (with links) with the main concepts to master for the exam.

## Recap üîñ

It's time to start doing the firsts **exams practice tests**&#x20;

By taking 5-10 tests, we may meter how short (or far) are from the **passing score** (which is around 80%). In these first tests I usually fall into 65-75 % so...&#x20;

Exams practice is process that helps to:

* outline key concepts
* improve concentration&#x20;
* improve reading comprehension

Time to write the document "**2 ¬∑ XXX Recap**" with a better perspective: at this point we must understand what is, and what is not, important for the "_real_" exam.&#x20;

## Flashcards üÉè

Unfortunately, on the exam there are responses that have to be learned by heart. This is a bit stupid,  our memory tends to release memorised information just a few days after; for this we have "flashcards" which is a kind of short-term memo-technique.

Let's write "**3 ¬∑ XXX Flashcards**" document with those values that we need to memorise.&#x20;

## Chats with Bard ü§ñ

Of course! AI is also part of my learning process. I have useful chats with Bard to clarify certain concepts by using natural language rather that seeking information on search engines.

{% hint style="info" %}
Bard is not always right. It is your responsibility to verify all information in case of doubts.
{% endhint %}

It is a good practice to index all the chats here "**4 ¬∑ XXX Chats with Bard**" for a later review.

## The Last Drop üç∫

At this point the exam is **already scheduled** and we are a few days to go; we notice that we are a little nervous while studying, just as a Scotsman would be when it is time for "_The Last Drop_".

These lasts days we MUST do the following:

* Intensify the number of practice tests per day
* Capture and debug wrong responses
* Identify concepts still weak&#x20;
* Index weak points in "**5 ¬∑ XXX The Last Drop**" document
* Review all notes, documents, chats and oficial documentation&#x20;

Good Luck!

This is a previous stage where I usually do a research on what the certification exam will cover. A good starting points to do so are:

* Read the official **Certification Exam Guide** (CEG) carefully.
* Read the **most up-to-date book** on the certification we're going to prepare.
* Explore **GitHub repositories** to find study **materials** and other **resources**.

After completing these steps we'll get a high-level overview of the main topics for the exam.

## Key Concepts ‚úç

Once we identified the main exam topics, it's time to get to work taking the corresponding _Learning Path_ in [**Cloud Skills Boost**](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/). I suggest not missing any lab on this.

And just when the Learning Path is done, we're in a good point to write down the documento "**1 ¬∑ XXX Key Concepts**", this document is an index (with links) with the main concepts to master for the exam.

Exams practice is process that helps to:

* outline key concepts
* improve concentration&#x20;
* reading comprehension

Time to write the document "**2 ¬∑ XXX Recap**" with better a perspective: at this point we must understand what is, and what is not, important for the "real" exam.&#x20;

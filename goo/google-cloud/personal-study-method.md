## From Zero to Hero 🦸‍♂️

This is a previous stage where I usually do a research on what the certification exam will cover. A good starting points to do so are:

* Read the official **Certification Exam Guide** (CEG) carefully.
* Read the **most up-to-date book** on the certification we're going to prepare.
* Explore **GitHub repositories** to find study **materials** and other **resources**.

After completing these steps we'll get a high-level overview of the main topics for the exam.
